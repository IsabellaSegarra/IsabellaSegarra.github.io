Before Bren, I studied Environmental Science at UC Merced, in the heart of the Central Valley. There, I developed a love for ecology; joining research projects studying fungal ecology, phenology, and even conducting my own research on grassland non-native species. For most of my undergrad experience, my research interests were all over the place and so I decided to study the data for the ecosystems and environmental processes I love. In my free time, I enjoy training for marathons (2x full; 1 half marathon), reading, and thrifting!"
